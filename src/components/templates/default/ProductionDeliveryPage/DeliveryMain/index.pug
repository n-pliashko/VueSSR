          | If your order does not arrive within the stated times, please do not worry; it is very likely that it will arrive very soon and may have just been delayed slightly in the mailing system. In line with Royal Mail guidelines, we will not consider a package lost until 2 weeks have passed. This is because the vast majority of packages will be delivered or returned to us as 'undeliverable' within this time.

We will send you a non-delivery form that must be completed so we can use as evidence of non-receipt in our claim with our shippers.
