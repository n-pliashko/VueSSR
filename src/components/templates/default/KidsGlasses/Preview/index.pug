            | As parents, the health, safety and well-being of our children is essential and in the summer the sun is a danger that shouldn't be ignored.  That's why we at SelectSpecs.com believe that protecting the eyes of our young ones is just as essential as protecting their skin from UV damage with sun screen.

            | We would recommend children wear sunglasses from an early age to protect their sensitive eyes from the sun's strong UV rays which will help prevent problems like cataracts and macular degeneration occurring later on in life.  However, trying to keep sunglasses on a baby may prove difficult and uncomfortable for them therefore they will try to pull the sunglasses off at the first opportunity!  Instead, it may be preferable to try a visor or a wide brimmed hat to protect your child's eyes and face from UV damage until they are comfortable wearing sunglasses.
